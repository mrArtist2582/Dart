## Introduction to Dart

Dart is an open-source, general-purpose programming language developed by Google, most commonly used for building mobile apps with Flutter. It is also used for web, server-side, and command-line applications. Dart features strong typing, asynchronous programming support, and modern libraries that make it suitable for both small and large applications.

### Key Features:
- **Strong Typing**: Helps avoid runtime errors with type-checking at compile time.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Utilizes `async`, `await`, and `Future` to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Cross-platform**: Primarily used with Flutter for building mobile apps but also great for web and server-side development.

## Console Applications

Dart allows you to create simple console applications, which are great for testing concepts and learning the basics.

### Example:
```dart
void main() {
  print("Hello, Dart!");
}
